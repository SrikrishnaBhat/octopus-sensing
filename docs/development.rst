Installing from source
======================

you need `poetry`:

>>> pip3 install poetry

(Refer to `Poetry installation guide <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`_ 
for alternative ways of installing Poetry.)

Then `cd` to where the source code located and run:

>>> poetry install
>>> poetry build

It will create a virtual environment and installs `octopus-sensing` with its dependencies in it.
