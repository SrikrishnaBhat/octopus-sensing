class BrainFlowOpenBCIStreaming(BrainFlowStreaming):
    '''
    Manages OpenBCI streaming

    Data will be recorded in a csv file/files with the following column order:
    channels, Acc_x, Acc_y, Acc_z, sample_id, time_stamp, trigger

    Attributes
    -----------
    name: str, optional
        device name
        This name will be used in the output path to identify each device's data
    
    output_path: str, optional
                 The path for recording files.
                 Audio files will be recorded in folder {output_path}/{name}
    
    saving_mode: int, optional, default = SavingModeEnum.CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE
        The way of saving data: saving continiously in a file or save data related to
        each stimulus in a separate file. 
        SavingModeEnum: CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE
                        SEPARATED_SAVING_MODE
    
    board_type: str, optional, default = "cyton-daisy"
                The type of OpenBCI boards that connect by USB dongle.
                It can be:
                cyton
                    for cyton board sampling rate is 250 and it has 8 channels
                cyton-daisy
                    for cyton-daisy board sampling rate is 125 and it has 16 channels
                ganglion
                    for Ganglion board sampling rate is 200 and it has 4 channels

    channels_order: list of str, default = None
        A list of channel names which specify the order and names of channels
