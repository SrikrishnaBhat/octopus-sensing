# Summary
Designing studies and collecting data is critical in exploring and recognizing human behavior automatically. Nonetheless, even when data are collected correctly, synchronizing data from multiple sensors is time-consuming and subject to human error. Failure to record and synchronize data can lead to incorrect analysis and results, and finally, repeat the time-consuming experiments several times. To overcome these challenges, `Octopus Sensing` facilitates synchronous data acquisition from various sources, provides some utilities for designing studies, real-time monitoring, and offline data visualization.  The major aim of `Octopus Sensing`is to simplify the scripting interface so that people with minimum or no software development skills can define experiment scenarios with no effort.


# Statement of need
External events affect the human body and mind. Many internal and external changes happen in the human body in response to external stimuli. Nowadays, researchers use various sensors to monitor and measure these responses to know more about humans [@kreibig2010autonomic; @chen2020physiological; @sun2020multimodal] and employ them in many healthcare applications like assisting patients or mental health monitoring [@hassouneh2020development], improve social interactions [@verschuere2006psychopathy; @hossain2019observers], and improve the quality of life by making intelligent devices like Intelligent Tutoring Systems [@dewan2019engagement] or making interactive robots and virtual characters [@val2020affective; @hong2020multimodal].

Recently, many researchers in human-computer interaction research areas try to achieve a deeper understanding of humans by simultaneously interpreting a combination of physiological and behavioral changes in the human body [@shu2018review; @koelstra2011deap]. Acquiring and analyzing data from different sources with various hardware and interface are complex, time-consuming, and challenging tasks. Also, recording data with multiple formats synchronously can be easily affected by human error. These tasks slow down the pace of progress in human computer interaction research.  There are a limited number of frameworks that support synchronous data acquisition. For example, [iMotions](@https://imotions.com/) has been provided software that integrates and synchronizes a wide range of various sensors and devices that record a considerable range of signals synchronously. Although iMotions offers many facilities, it is expensive. Also, it is not open-source and cannot easily integrate with all research conditions.

`Octopus Sensing` is a lightweight open-source multi-platform library that facilitates synchronous data acquisition from various sources and can be extended to process and analyze data in real-time. It provides a web-based real-time monitoring system that can be used remotely to illustrate and monitor signals in real-time. Also, it offers offline data visualization to see the changes in various sensors simultaneously.

# Overview

Octopus Sensing is a tool to help in running scientific experiments that involve recording data synchronously from multiple sources in human-computer interaction studies. It can collect data from various devices such as [OpenBCI EEG headset](https://openbci.com/), [Shimmer3 sensor](https://shimmersensing.com) (GSR and PPG), Video and Audio and so forth simultaneously. Data collection can be started and stopped synchronously across all devices. The main features of `Octopus Sensing` are listed as follows.

## Main featuresÔÉÅ

* Manages data recording from multiple sources using a simple unified interface.
* Minimizes human errors from manipulating data in synchronous data collection.
* Provides some utilities for designing studies like showing different stimuli or designing questionnaires.
* Offers monitoring interface that prepares and visualizes collected data in real-time.
* Provides offline visualization of data from multiple sources simultaneously.

# Research perspective

We used `Octopus Sensing` in designing several experiments in human emotion recognition. We designed the experiment and recorded facial video, brain, and physiological signals using `Octopus Sensing` in a watching video task to recognize emotion [@Saffaryazdi2021]. This scenario which is common in multimodal emotion recognition studies, has been included in the repository as an example. Also, in another research study, we collected multimodal data in a face-to-face conversation task to analyze human emotional responses [@Saffaryazdi2021conv].

This tool can be used as the base structure for creating real-time data processing systems like systems with capabilities to recognize emotions, stress, cognitive load, or analyze human behaviors. In the future, we want to extend its features to provide real-time emotion recognition using multimodal data analysis.
